In this file I have analysed differnt sampling techniques over a range of classification models.
The sampling techniques involved in the project are:
1)Random Sampling
2)Systematic Sampling
3)K-fold cross Validation
4)Cluster Sampling
5)Bootstrap Sampling

The models on which these are applied are:
1)Random Forest Classifier 
2)KNN
3)SVM
4)Logistic Classifier
5)XGBoost Classifier
